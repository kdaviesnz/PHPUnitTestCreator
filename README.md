# PHPUnitTestCreator

Create unit tests for classes.

Current restrictions:
- Only works with pure methods.
- Only works for methods that have no parameters.
- Class constructor must have no parameters.

(It is alpha!)

Future versions hopefully won't have the parameter restriction and will support a config file to enable users to override inputs / outputs without having to edit the generated test file.
